Welcome to **Zeroro2DGame**, my first ever game project! This is a 2D adventure game where you can explore, collect items, and avoid hazards. Built with [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/), this project helped me dive into the world of game development.

## 📜 About the Game

**Zeroro2DGame** is a simple 2D game designed to help me understand the basics of game mechanics, physics, and visual storytelling. The game features:

- A character that can move, jump, and interact with objects.
- A variety of obstacles 🕹️ challenges.
- A kill zone that resets the game when triggered.

The primary objective of the game is to navigate through levels, collect items, and avoid falling into hazardous zones.
